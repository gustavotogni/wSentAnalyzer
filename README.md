```
py -m pip install pandas
py -m pip install requests
py -m pip install squarify
py -m pip install sklearn
py -m pip install nltk
py -m nltk.downloader stopwords
```

4. To run the application:

- wAnalyzer is the main entry point.
- The 1st parameter is the path to the source csv file.
- If the provided file does not exist, the application will instantiate a WebCrawler and create one with life results from the web.

# 2. Architecture

![Architecture Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19785036/60141894-dd454c80-978d-11e9-9849-5dcdc9e1b178.png)

# 3. Inputs & Outputs

The Python program should be able to expect as input a CSV data-set with anonymized user-id and posts contents.

As output the program will provide a usersâ€˜ personality traits clustering about that social network sample and the feature set utilized as well as plots of interesting characteristics. The files are all created in "./output".
