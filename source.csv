We live daily miracles in every supplier, friend, family member who helps us realize our dream. The big day comes with a dose of expectation, lump in the throat, anxiety and fulfillment. There's no way to describe the moment of -SIM-, just that you've lived. And the post, which is married life, which is forever.

A month and a half later he officially asked me to date, and six months later I won the first engagement ring. It's been 15 and a half years together. When we turned 14 he asked me to marry him officially (as we had been talking about it for a long time) I won a wedding ring and bonbons. It was very intimate (only us), but unforgettable 😍.

But I didn't say I was getting married tomorrow. I just said I was getting married. And then there was a man who looked at me and said, “Stop being an idiot. “ Marrying is the worst thing in someone's life. I was paralyzed. I remember he said, “Marriage is horrible, it's terrible, it's all wrong. It was talking, it was putting weight on me, and me getting bad, and everybody around bad. When he finished talking, I gathered all the intern courage I had and looked at him and said, “Are you married?” He said, “No. “ And I said, “What are you, then? He told me, I'm divorced. I said, “So let me tell you something. “ If I want to know about marriage, I'll ask who it worked for. We have to do this. We have to stop accepting mistakes from generations that have been passed on to us. We have to stop accepting bad legacies. Take responsibility. Say, my marriage will be happy.

I choose to work. You're not a hostage to the past. There's a new story. This is very simple. Well, my wedding day came and when I went to get married, my mother asked me, “Son, what do you want your wedding to be like? What do you mean, mom? Do you want him to be a blessing or hell?

457,viviane-jackson-2019,"TAKE TIME TO READ THIS GIRLS STORY I SAW IN A BLOG ❤ I MET MY WIFE at 16. And I remember working in this time as an intern at a bank. I remember I was in the kitchen on the bench, sitting at the table. I remember I turned to the staff and said, “Guys, I found out the woman I'm getting married to. Everyone thought, “Really? But I didn't say I was getting married tomorrow. I just said I was getting married. And then there was a man who looked at me and said, “Stop being an idiot. “ Marrying is the worst thing in someone's life. I was paralyzed. I remember he said, “Marriage is horrible, it's terrible, it's all wrong. It was talking, it was putting weight on me, and me getting bad, and everybody around bad. When he finished talking, I gathered all the intern courage I had and looked at him and said, “Are you married?” He said, “No. “ And I said, “What are you, then? He told me, I'm divorced. I said, “So let me tell you something. “ If I want to know about marriage, I'll ask who it worked for. We have to do this. We have to stop accepting mistakes from generations that have been passed on to us. We have to stop accepting bad legacies. Take responsibility. Say, my marriage will be happy. Did you get a divorce in family history? Look over here and say, “Your marriage will work. “ Did you have treason? I will be faithful to my wife until the end. Because it's our choice. I choose to work. You're not a hostage to the past. There's a new story. This is very simple. Well, my wedding day came and when I went to get married, my mother asked me, “Son, what do you want your wedding to be like? What do you mean, mom? Do you want him to be a blessing or hell? I said, “I want it to be a blessing. She didn't say: so CHOOSE. Mom, what do you mean? When we choose, our attitudes that follow after the choice match the choice we made. If I want to have a happy marriage, I know what to do. And what not to do. So you have every reason not to go wrong. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY!"

480,natanael-maria,"Our story started when I was 15, and he was 18. We didn't know each other in person yet, but do you remember when people were texting from their own mobile phone and not even whatsapp existed? So that's how our long conversations began! It was during class, work, breakfast, lunch and dinner. All we had to do was talk during the rsrs bath. At that time, I was a sophomore year of high school, and Nathanael, first year of business school. As time went by, the meetings became more frequent and he would walk me home practically every day, just to keep me company. We talked hours in front of the house gate!!! This whole process of getting to know each other reminds me of our first date, where we went to the mall in Hortolandia to have lunch at McDonald's (super romantic rsrs), but that was what he could afford back then! Well, time has passed and passion has increased!! So it was April 10th, 2013, at 10:00 in the morning, that I was surprised in the middle of school with signs that said, “Do you want to date me?” At that point I went into shock, the whole school looking at me and me not knowing what to do. But then of course I said yes! After that day, two years passed, I graduated from high school and started to go to psychology school in São Paulo. Think of a suffering!!! Dating from a distance isn't easy, especially for someone who's used to seeing each other every day. It was too much crying and consolation for this phase to be overcome. But time went by and we were adjusting. This year thank God I will be graduating and so we can get married finally!!! Time has passed and a lot has happened! We fight a lot yes (because no one is perfect, right?) , but thank God we turned the top to get where we are today. Without maturation, learning, and communion with Him, we would certainly not be together making preparations for our marriage. I think six years of dating here would have enough pages to write a book. How many achievements and surpasses have come together that I can't even imagine if we were alone, where each one would be struggling to achieve what we have today as a result of our teamwork. Without companionship, nothing would have worked out. April 19, 2020 is coming and soon we will be able to write a new chapter of our story!!!"

These were not by far the main reasons for this invitation you know? You know what your fiancée friend thought when she asked you to be godmother? The prank afternoons you guys had after school. The time she told you firsthand that she had been asked to date by her fiancé. She remembered the trips to theaters, the endless conversations on the phone. When she decided to invite you, she was thrilled to remember that it was you who helped her hold the bar she passed and that you were there when she began to live a beautiful love story! You remembered the day you were asked to marry you and you thought about the time: - I need to call my friend to tell her how this moment was. - Some things have changed, others may change, but you know that this connection well time will erase. ❤ Marsala's Bridesmaids!"
552,simone-guilherme-2019,"Your fiancée friend is going to need help on this walk down the aisle, but when the big day comes, she's going to want a lot more of your name on the dress bar, more than a picture of the lively class. She'll want your tighter hug, the look that says, “I'll always be here by your side. “ And get ready to stay exactly where you are, next to me! That's where you as godmother will need to stay! As a godmother you will need to advise, calm down, remedy, but sometimes as a godmother you will only need to listen, but do not forget, this care can never miss. 💕 Pink Bridesmaids"

Our save the date was like this, same theme as our invitation, I chose to send the whatsapp of 1 member of each family, so I saved with impression and had more time to prepare the formal invitation, another thing that makes it easier for you to save the date is that you can start delivering the invitations closer to the wedding, thus avoiding the oblivion of people and believe me, even the loss of it!

With all the improbability of love and nothing in its favor... after all the distance was long, the money short... is friends wasn't easy. Little by little things were changing and life was settling. He put her into your life and together he grabbed that little bag of love she was carrying. He learned the practice of being a paidrasto-, he accepted that maturing wasn't just leaving his video games aside. And that more people depended on this abrupt maturity that he would have to have. She accepted that I know how to be a teenager was actually one of the qualities I would appreciate most about him.

One night, coming back from my uncertain destinies, I parked without paying attention to a parking spot. Hours later I wake up with intercom to put the car in the right spot. After the correction, I apologized to the woman, but I do not remember her. She remembers!!! CONTACTFUL... One day! Day of isolation and study, I went to the Home Office of the building due to the comfort of the tables. Who was there? She did, but she didn't know she was the woman in the parking lot. Bottom line: listening to your conversation with someone else, I asked about your project and we switched phone. Hours later I confirmed the note and said okay and we never spoke again. THANK YOU TO AES ELECTROPAULO End of February/19: arriving at the building after work I come across Lisandra. Yes, she did! Socializing at the reception, there was no power in the building. I stopped my car and went to prose too. But I confess to you, Lisandra, I wanted to know if you were single. At one point I asked and listened to the beautiful words (single)..... I left without thinking about anything.... ON A TYPICAL MONDAY 25/02 Everything depended on a series of variables to invite her to dinner. A complicated day, tired and in need of something new, an inspiration... I remembered that beautiful woman, the Super Woman... rsrs.... I went straight: -Wednesday I come home early, do you want to eat something, like Japanese food? If you do not eat Japanese food may be something your choice... - Accepted!!! Lisandra Lisandra Spectacular dinner at my favorite place in your very pleasant company... A good conversation, smart, I find you amazing... and of course beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... The days passed and enjoyed my best carnival next to you. I keep it on record for good. Remember that you met someone who was very happy on this date because of you. All in the greatest possible naturalness, of course you allowing all this. If I had received a “no “that day life would go on without thinking about this passionate woman... Life is really complicated, never easy, only dealing with complicated things, one more to think about... kkkkkk. So to face these angry waves, I keep the bow forward and safely want to dive deep into this sea... kisses and lots of kisses for you from a guy who likes to live his life in the best company.

But I didn't say I was getting married tomorrow. I just said I was getting married. And then there was a man who looked at me and said, “Stop being an idiot. “ Marrying is the worst thing in someone's life. I was paralyzed. I remember he said, “Marriage is horrible, it's terrible, it's all wrong. It was talking, it was putting weight on me, and me getting bad, and everybody around bad. When he finished talking, I gathered all the intern courage I had and looked at him and said, “Are you married?” He said, “No. “ And I said, “What are you, then? He told me, I'm divorced. I said, “So let me tell you something. “ If I want to know about marriage, I'll ask who it worked for. We have to do this. We have to stop accepting mistakes from generations that have been passed on to us. We have to stop accepting bad legacies. Take responsibility. Say, my marriage will be happy. Did you get a divorce in family history? Look over here and say, “Your marriage will work. “ Did you have treason? I will be faithful to my wife until the end. Because it's our choice. I choose to work. You're not a hostage to the past. There's a new story. This is very simple. Well, my wedding day came and when I went to get married, my mother asked me, “Son, what do you want your wedding to be like? What do you mean, mom? Do you want him to be a blessing or hell? I said, “I want it to be a blessing. She didn't say: so CHOOSE. Mom, what do you mean? When we choose, our attitudes that follow after the choice match the choice we made. If I want to have a happy marriage, I know what to do. And what not to do. So you have every reason not to go wrong. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY!"

In the middle of the way or even near the end of realizing your dream will come doubts, discouragement more remember before this dream is dreamed by you was dreamed first by God.

The company is Decooprisma Ceremonial, organization and planning of Events of Porto Alegre located at Rua La Plata, 467, Fone (51) 37e7-7630 The personalized service and affection of Deise and Ed with my husband Pedro, in its particularities, was undoubtedly the differential.

The tip is to stay in BVB for at least 7 days and buy with time to get better prices. The most economical price we saw for the stretch PFB to BVB (good vis-rr) was R $1,300.00 round trip. If you can, leave in a group, it helps to reduce the cost of transportation to Passo Fundo airport.

Moments that we have to spend, whether good or bad, being close or distant from each other, for our own learning and for the strengthening of the couple. Never forgetting the most important thing: Nothing in this life is by chance. Absolutely nothing. Then God allowed Joseph and Ingrid to know each other and there would begin a small story, which later a seed of the formation of a family would be born in their hearts. Well, today we report a few moments that through this time of singles, we share with you."

The video showed pictures of us with the godparents, and in the end, I asked the question. It was cool because everyone thought it was a Save the Date- video and not an invitation - custom box containing a party bag, a tie, and the godparents' manual. Enttegated after the video. The surprise reactions were inexplicable! I recommend it."

After then 1 year began some changes in the company and the end of contracts, so we glimpsed the possibility of the daily contact that we could close, with this arose the need to gather everyone for a farewell and on August 27, 2010, it was Friday night, amid colleagues happened our first kiss, and what should be a farewell became the beginning of a new relationship, then we went through various challenges and trials, and after 5 years inevitable we had to end the relationship. However, this period of detachment has proved crucial for us to mature and decisive in creating the strong and solid relationship that we have today. And once again what should be the end has become the foundation that was pending to build something even greater and today grateful for all that we live we have the certainty that we can deliver with faith our love for God that will consolidate our union with the sacrament of marriage."

1919,genilsa-manoeljr,"In marriage, the little things are the big things. It's never too old to hold hands, he says. Remember to say love to you, at least once a day. It's never going to sleep angry. It is to have common values and goals. It's to be united in facing the world. It's forming a circle of love as a whole family. It is to utter praise and be able to forgive and forget. It is to provide an atmosphere where each person can grow in the reciprocal search for good and beautiful. It's not just marrying the right person, but being the perfect companion. And to be the perfect companion you need to have a good mood and optimism. Being natural and knowing how to act with tact. It is knowing how to listen carefully, without interrupting at every moment. It is to show admiration and confidence, being interested in the problems and activities of the other. Ask him what torments him, what makes him happy, why he's upset. It is to be discreet, knowing the moment to leave the companion alone so that he can put his thoughts in order. It is to distribute affection and understanding, combining love and poetry, without forgetting gallantry and courtesy. It's the wisdom to repeat the moments of dating. Those magical moments when the orchestra of the world seemed to play only for the two of us. It is to be the support in front of others. It's to be careful in language, it's to be firm, loyal. It is to have attention beyond the trivial and to be able to find out when one has done something to the other. A new haircut, a different dress, small but important details. It is to know how to pay attention to the family of the other, because by joining the couple, the two families form a unit. It is cultivating the constant desire for overcoming. It is to respond worthily and fairly for all acts. It's to be grateful for everything that one means in another's life. Real love, by keeping its roots in balance, is firming day by day through close coexistence. Love, born of a progressive and mature experience, does not tend to end, but expands, since those involved come to know vices and virtues, manies and customs of each other. The balance of love promotes the practice of justice and goodness, cooperation and sense of duty, affectivity and mature warning."

2509,wagner-francine-2018,"What's so special about the fruitcake? This has to do with refrigerators, which were not a hot commodity during the Middle Ages (since they did not exist at the time). Since the fruit cake is traditionally made with rum liqueur or cognac (like this beautiful white fruit cake), alcohol acts as a natural preservative for the cake. The fruit inside the cake will function as sentinels, which means they will pick up water molecules that could escape by evaporation. This keeps the cake pleasant and moist, as well as it does not spoil for long periods of time."
